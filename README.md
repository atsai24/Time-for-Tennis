 ## Introduction
 Singles tennis is a greuling, tiring, and highly intense form of competition. Due to the nature of the 1 vs. 1, there is no delegating or relying on teammates. Every serve, point, and hit relies entirely upon the individual player's performance, thus it is natural for players to take time between points to gather and ready themselves for the next serve. In this analysis, I attempt to quantify these psychological factors of the game, and explore a dateset of measured times after the end of a point and before the next serve in the 2015 French Open.
 
 ## Data
 The Data was collected by Carl Bialik from FiveThirtyEight for his [analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-some-tennis-matches-take-forever/) of why some tennis matches take so long. Using a stopwatch, he measured the time it took for 15 players to serve in the 2015 French Open.
